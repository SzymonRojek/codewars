/*
Description:
Given an array, find the duplicates in that array, and return a new array of those duplicates. The elements of the returned array should appear in the order when they first appeared as duplicates.

Note: numbers and their corresponding string representations should not be treated as duplicates (i.e., '1' !== 1).
